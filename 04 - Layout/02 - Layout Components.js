// Layout System Example Components

// The Vertical List can layout items in vertically based on their dynamic
// height. It also provides its own total height so that it can be used as
// an item within itself.

class VerticalList {

      layoutWidth: this.props.width || this.context.layoutWidth
    };

  // NEW FEATURE: Pre-render a subtree before continuing with the normal render.
  preRender() {
    // Children that needs to be prerendered. If some children needs to be
    // prerendered, but not others (e.g. for flexbox layouts), then they're
    // filtered, here and the rest is rendered inside render.
    return this.props.children;

      // This child is an opaque black box whose props cannot be inspected,
      // nor cloned. It can only be rendered once. Rendering it twice results
      // in a conflict, at least until we support painting the same stateful
      // component in many different places (e.g. SVG's <use />)

  // result back up the tree.
